Description: Abstraction (Interface), by use case. We can use implements like this- (a class can implement multiple interfaces) 
                                  public class Weapon implements ItemStuff, Itemproduct, Other {  
                                                . . .  
                                  }  
                        Or we can use extends as like Inheritance-  
                                  public class Weapon extends SomeClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
                                    // Must implement all abstract methods from interfaces
                                    // Can also override or use methods from the superclass
                                  }
